# Franka RF3 hardware example

These are the examples of getting control of the robort hardware.

The publisher will publish the target joints value or end-effector pose.

The controller will receive the target value and talk to hardware to move. 

## Example 1: Joint position motion

move_to_pose.cpp

generate_joint_position_publisher.cpp

## Example 2: Cartesian positon motion

move_to_cartesian_pose.cpp

generate_pose_position_publisher.cpp
